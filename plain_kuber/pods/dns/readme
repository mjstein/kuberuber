NOTE A few things. 
KUBEDNS has the ip of the kubeapi
NOTE ALSO THAT THE DOMAIN IS CONSISTANT and needs to be placed in the kubelet config as so:
KUBELET_ARGS="--cluster-dns=10.254.0.2 --cluster-domain=k8s.local" for all nodes
not that cluster dns is the name of the service created. and cluster-domain is the domain name used in our confi
Dont forget that the cluster services and pods will need to be restarted!
